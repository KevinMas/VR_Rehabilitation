Leap motion SDK has been modified in order to apply correctly filter script.

In order to show a hand on the screen, it is mandatory to add "Left/Right Hand Low Pass filter" script on leap motion hand object.
If you don't want to apply the filter set the T value to 0.01.

In this project, each exercises are represented as scenes with an explicit name..

Low Pass filter is applied on CapsuleHand_L and CapsuleHand_R with by default 0.01 as T value (means no filtering).
CapsuleHand_L and CapsuleHand_R  can be found on LMHeadMountedRig -> HandModels

One each CapsuleHand_L and CapsuleHand_R  there is also a record scrpit which record position of palm position and all finger chosen with checkbox. By default the folder where CSV file is saved, is C:\\Users\\ケビン\\Documents, but you can change it in the inspector. A CSV file is save. Then I was using an opensource software to make graphics (DatPlot). 

Concerning exercises, you can find scripts on the object named InteractionCube.
